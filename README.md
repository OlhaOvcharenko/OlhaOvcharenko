<h1 align="center">Hi there üëãüèª I'm Junior Full Stack Developer üë©üèª‚Äçüéì</h1>

 
  I am actively improving my skills and always ready to get new knowledge as much as possible.
 
  At the beginning of my venture as a developer I find it both challenging and engaging simultaneously. It's sparked a multitude of questions
  and a strong desire to delve deeper into the subject matter.
  
  Equally attracted to front-end and back-end development, I try to keep pace with the latest updates and innovations in both areas,
  constantly seeking out new ideas and advancements in the world of technology.
  
  I firmly believe that dedicated practice and focused learning will lead to the desired results.
